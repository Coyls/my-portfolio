My name is Lo√Øc, and I am a fullstack web developer, specializing in **TypeScript**, **React** / **Next.js** for the frontend, and **Node.js** for the backend. What excites me is building complete applications, from the user interface to the backend architecture, with a focus on smoothness and performance.

I place a high value on three aspects of my work:

- **Client**: fully understanding needs to deliver truly tailored solutions.
- **User**: providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience (UX).
- **Developer**: writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code to ensure long-term reliability.

I am also used to collaborating with designers to ensure coherence between design and development. I particularly enjoy **SaaS B2B** projects because they pose exciting technical challenges and give me the opportunity to innovate.
