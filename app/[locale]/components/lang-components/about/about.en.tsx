      <p>
        I&apos;m currently a fullstack web developer, mainly using TypeScript
        and Next.js. I&apos;m gradually specializing in backend and DevOps, with
        a desire to understand systems better, to make them more reliable and
        more fluid. That&apos;s the direction I want to go in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m working on improving my backend skills. Right now, I&apos;m
        actively learning with NestJS and following the backend track on
        Boot.dev. I&apos;m learning how to structure more solid and better
        organized APIs, and I take the time to understand the foundations behind
        what I write.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I&apos;m passionate about longboard dancing,
        cardistry and magic. I love fluidity, whether in a gesture, a
        transition, or a well-thought-out system.
