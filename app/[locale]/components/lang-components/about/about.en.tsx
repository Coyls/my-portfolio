      <p>
        I&apos;m currently a fullstack web developer, mainly using TypeScript
        and Next.js. I&apos;m gradually specializing in backend and DevOps, with
        a desire to understand systems better, to make them more reliable and
        more fluid. That&apos;s the direction I want to go in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love learning, automating and building simple, useful tools. Right
        now, I&apos;m spending a lot of time experimenting with self-hosting. I
        like to understand how things work, deploy it myself, and keep control
        of what I&apos;m building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I&apos;m passionate about longboard dancing,
        cardistry and magic. I love fluidity, whether in a gesture, a
        transition, or a well-thought-out system.
