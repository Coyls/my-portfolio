      <p>
        My name is Lo√Øc, and I am a fullstack web developer, specializing in
        <span className="font-bold">TypeScript</span>,{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">React</span> /{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">Next.js</span> for the frontend, and{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">Node.js</span> for the backend. What excites
        me is building complete applications, from the user interface to the
        backend architecture, with a focus on smoothness and performance.
      </p>
      <p>I place a high value on three aspects of my work:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">Client</span>: fully understanding needs
          to deliver truly tailored solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">User</span>: providing a seamless and
          enjoyable user experience (UX).
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-bold">Developer</span>: writing clean,
          maintainable, and scalable code to ensure long-term reliability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I am also used to collaborating with designers to ensure coherence
        between design and development. I particularly enjoy{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">SaaS B2B</span> projects because they pose
        exciting technical challenges and give me the opportunity to innovate.
